## BioImage Analysis tools
Simple bioimage analysis macro/scripts developed at Advanced Light Microscopy Facility at I3S, Porto Portugal

## ImageJ/Fiji
* LIFtoTIFF: Convert the series of a LIF file into TIF format
* FromInCellToHyperstack: convert InCell images in hyperstack arranged by wells and fields
* Spheroids_intensity_measure: Process a folder of InCell images (arranged by wells and fields), to determine spheroid morphometric features and analyse mean inetnsity values of a specific channel inside the spheroid 
* Woundhealing_TimeSegmentation: calculate wound healing area of a time-lapse image
* StarDist_process_folder:  apply a pre trained StarDist 2D model to a folder of images
* FRETratiometrics: analyse ratiometric FRET signal on images acquired in widefield inverted microscopes or laser point scanning confocal systems (new version at: https://github.com/mafsousa/FretRatiometric)
